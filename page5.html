<h2>React</h2>

<p> My experience with React could be rated 7/10</p>

<h3>Ease to use</h3>
<p>The react framework had a steep learning curve to learn how to use it and also to configure it. You have to learn how to use a confusing IDE and understand the concept of reusable components and one way data binding. </p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>The great thing about react was that once I learned how to use it I was able to drastically simplify my code because of the reusable components. THe great thing about react is that it is a popular framework so there were a lot of tutorials online teaching me how to use it. I would use react for applications where there are a lot of repetitive components because react helps me to reuse components.</p>

<h3>Learning Curve</h3>
<p> React was a language that was moderatel;y difficult to install and use. The installation took a long time and it also took time to create a single react project. It is definately harder to learn than traditional HTML/CSS/Javascript because the React syntax builds upon the HTMl/CSS/Javascript but it was not too hard to get used to.</p>

<h2>Node</h2>

<p> My experience with Node could be rated 10/10</p>

<h3>Ease to use</h3>
<p>Node was one of the simplest and easiest back end frameworks to learn how to use. The installation process was simple. All you have to run a web app in node is type node your_js_ file name in the command line and the app could run.</p>


<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>There were many useful modules such as express, socket.io. Fs, and mysql to perform many tasks. It was also very easy  to learn and the code written in node was extremely simple. I would use node for many of the web applications that I would develop since it is extremely easy to install and use. It does support multithreading so I would not use it for CPU intensive applications. For CPU intensive applications Java, C++ or C# would make for a better backend since it supports multithreading. </p>

<h3>Learning Curve</h3>
<p> Node was one of the easiest and most functional languages to use. The moduels express and socket.io that I used were extermely easy to learn, use, and install. They all did extremely important tasks and the code that had to be written was easy to write and understand.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I did not regret my hcoice of frameowrks because I used the best frameworks that I could have used for this project. React simplified by code with one way data binding and reusable components. Node was simple to install and run. The code that I had to write for node was also relatively simple. Node also had so many modules that simplified back end tasks such as express to route to the different pages and socket.io to send messages between different web clients.</p>

<p>In retrospect I would have done things differently next time. I would have wrote the front end code with HTML/CSS/Javascript without using any fancy framework like React. Using a framework takes time to learn and install and with traditional HTML/CSS/Javascript you can just open up the text editor and get started developing right away. I actually created the same chat application with HTML/CSS/Javascript and its was easier than using React because I didn't have to configure the react project in my directory and there was less code to write so it was simplier</p>
