<h2>React</h2>

<h3>Ease to use</h3>
<p>The react framework had a steep learning curve to learn how to use it and also to configure it. You have to learn how to use a confusing IDE and understand the concept of reusable components and one way data binding. </p>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<p>The great thing about react was that once I learned how to use it I was able to drastically simplify my code because of the reusable components. THe great thing about react is that it is a popular framework so there were a lot of tutorials online teaching me how to use it. I would use react for applications where there are a lot of repetitive components because react helps me to reuse components.</p>


<h2>Node</h2>

<h3>Ease to use</h3>
<p>Node was one of the simplest and easiest back end frameworks to learn how to use. The installation process was simple. All you have to run a web app in node is type node your_js_file name in the command line and the app could run.</p>


<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>There were many useful modules such as express, socket.io. Fs, and mysql to perform many tasks. It was also very easy  to learn and the code written in node was extremely simple. I would use node for many of the web applications that I would develop since it is extremely easy to install and use. It does support multithreading so I would not use it for CPU intensive applications. For CPU intensive applications Java, C++ or C# would make for a better backend since it supports multithreading. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I did not regret my hcoice of frameowrks because I used the best frameworks that I could have used for this project. React simplified by code with one way data binding and reusable components. Node was simple to install and run. The code that I had to write for node was also relatively simple. Node also had so many modules that simplified back end tasks such as express to route to the different pages and socket.io to send messages between different web clients.</p>
